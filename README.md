## Updates and Breaking Changes

This module is something I am putting together to allow everyone to have easy-to-use tools to generate interactional 
data.  This project is not polished production code that has been battle hardened, but something I am building publicly 
as part of a blog series that will improve over time.  Sometimes, those changes are going to be breaking.  I'll start 
considering commitments to backwards compatibility once we hit v1.0.0.

Happy coding!  :)
